# Item Tracker

## Project Summary
**Item Tracker** is a C++ program that analyzes purchasing patterns of grocery items to help identify frequently bought products. This solution allows users to query item purchase frequencies, print a comprehensive frequency list, and generate a visual histogram. The program reads item data from an input file and saves the frequency results in a backup file. By giving insights into item popularity, it helps optimize store layout for better customer experience.

## Reflections

### What did I do particularly well?
One area I handled particularly well was **modularity and organization**. By encapsulating core functions into the `ItemTracker` class, the code is well-structured, easy to test, and straightforward to maintain. Breaking down functionality into clearly defined methods, such as `readInputFile`, `printAllItems`, and `writeFrequencyToFile`, keeps each method focused on a specific task and streamlines the code.

### Where could I enhance my code?
There are a few areas for improvement:
- **Input Validation**: Adding robust validation for menu options and item names would enhance user experience and prevent potential errors.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling, especially for file operations (e.g., checking if files open correctly), would make the program more robust and secure.
- **Data Storage Optimization**: For larger datasets, switching to an unordered map could improve efficiency, as it provides average O(1) lookups, making the code more scalable.

These enhancements would make the program more secure, user-friendly, and performant, especially when handling higher data volumes.

### Which pieces of the code were most challenging, and how did I overcome this?
The most challenging part was managing file I/O operations, particularly handling duplicate items and edge cases. Using `std::map` to track item frequencies helped simplify this, as it automatically incremented counts as each item was read from the file. To overcome challenges, I referenced C++ documentation and online resources, such as forums and Stack Overflow, to confirm syntax and best practices, especially for handling maps and file streams effectively.

### Transferable Skills
- **File I/O Handling**: Skills in reading from and writing to files are highly transferable and applicable to many projects, as file operations are common in various programming contexts.
- **Using Data Structures Effectively**: Working with maps for frequency counting and organizing data efficiently is a valuable skill, especially when handling large datasets.
- **Implementing Modular Design**: Creating modular code by separating concerns into classes and functions is beneficial for nearly any coding project and enhances both clarity and reusability.

### How did I make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To ensure the program is easy to read and maintain:
- **Clear Naming Conventions**: Descriptive variable and function names make the codeâ€™s purpose easily understandable.
- **In-Line Comments**: Key parts of the code are annotated with comments to explain logic, especially in areas like file reading and frequency calculation.
- **Modular Design**: By encapsulating functionality within the `ItemTracker` class, the program is highly modular, making it easy to add features or adjust existing ones without impacting unrelated sections of code.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Following consistent indentation and spacing practices keeps the code cleaner and easier to navigate, aiding readability and debugging.
